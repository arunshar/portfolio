Arun Sharma graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota in June 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Shashi Shekhar. His research lies at the intersection of spatial data science and GeoAI, with a focus on physics-informed and diffusion-based models for spatiotemporal anomaly detection, trajectory data mining, and decision-focused spatial reasoning in high-stakes domains such as maritime safety and climate risk. His work has appeared in leading venues including AAAI, SIAM Data Mining, ACM SIGSPATIAL, and ACM Transactions, and was recognized with the University of Minnesota’s prestigious Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship (2022–2023). Arun earned his M.S. in Computer Science from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 2018, serves as a regular reviewer for conferences and journals such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, and SIGKDD, and actively mentors students and teaches courses in spatial data science, databases, and algorithms.
