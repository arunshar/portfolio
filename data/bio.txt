Arun Sharma is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, advised by Prof. Shashi Shekhar. His research advances spatial data science, machine learning, and uncertainty quantification, developing novel algorithms for geospatial AI, anomaly detection, and generative modeling to tackle global challenges in biodiversity, maritime safety, and climate change. His work has pioneered physics-aware methods for trajectory analysis, scalable detection algorithms for spatiotemporal anomalies, and AI-driven predictive models for environmental sustainability. His research has been recognized through the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship and published in premier venues, including SIGKDD, SIGSPATIAL, and SDM. He is an active reviewer for leading conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, and CVPR. Beyond research, Arun has mentored students across academic levels, shaping the next generation of AI and data science researchers. He earned his M.S. in Computer Science from SUNY Buffalo, working under Prof. Varun Chandola. After graduation, Arun is looking forward to working in the areas of spatial data science and machine learning.
